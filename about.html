    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      SkyCast is a weather forecast web application developed as part of my student project to explore and apply web development concepts. 
      As someone passionate about technology and design, I wanted to build something meaningful that could combine real-time data with a clean user interface. 
      This project helped me understand how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together, along with integrating third-party APIs.

      The app allows users to search for any city and instantly view the current weather, temperature, humidity, and wind details. 
      It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data.
      I focused on keeping the interface simple, responsive, and user-friendly, making it a great starting point for anyone exploring web development.
